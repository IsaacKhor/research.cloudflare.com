Christopher Wood is a Research Lead at Cloudflare Research. Outside of Cloudflare, he is co-chair of the TLS and MASQUE working groups at the IETF, as well as the PEARG research group in the IRTF. Before joining Cloudflare, Christopher worked on transport security, privacy, and cryptography engineering at Apple, as well as future Internet architectures at Xerox PARC. His interests lay at the intersection of network protocol design, communications security, privacy, and applied cryptography. 
At Cloudflare, he leads projects focused on security and privacy enhancements to network protocols such as TLS, QUIC, and DNS; emerging cryptographic protocol development and standardization such as Hybrid Public Key Encryption and OPAQUE; protocol evolution and ecosystem readiness in preparation for Post Quantum cryptographic algorithms; and privacy-preserving network architecture and protocol shifts such as Tor and Oblivious HTTP. Christopher holds a Ph.D. in computer science from UC Irvine.
