Deepak is a PhD candidate at Cornell Tech, New York City. His research lies in self-sovereign / decentralized identity, a new form of identity that offers users greater control over their data. His work often lies in the field of applied cryptography, which includes designing cryptographic protocols, building end-to-end systems, and arguing their security formally. Before his PhD, he received an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from IIT Bombay. More recently, he interned at Cloudflare working on the design and development of a "privacy-preserving attestation of personhood" leveraging cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs.
