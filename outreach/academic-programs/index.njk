<h1>Academic Programs</h1>

Research is integral to Cloudflareâ€™s mission as is the commitment to contribute back to the research and standards communities by establishing and maintaining a growing number of collaborations. Our research work spreads across multiple areas and results in many cases from collaborations between multiple Cloudflare teams and academic partners. 
<br />
<br />
Cloudflare aims to foster a shared motivation with academia and engage together in seeking innovative solutions to help build a better Internet in several domains. 
To support the exploration of new ideas, we offer two types of meaningful engagements.
<br />
<br />
<b>> Research Internships</b> area available all year long. Interns are paired with mentors and are expected to contribute to our exciting research, ship code and present results publicly. Learn <a href="interns/"><b>more</b></a>.
<br />
<br />
<b>> Visiting Researcher Program</b> is available to postdocs and full-time faculty members who aim to collaborate primarily with Cloudflare Research for periods of three to 12 months. Learn <a href="researchers/"><b>more</b></a>.
