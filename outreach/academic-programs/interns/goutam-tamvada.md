Goutam Tamvada has a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo. Since 2019, he has been a core member of the Open Quantum Safe project working in the area of applied post-quantum cryptography on such aspects as integrating and evaluating post-quantum cryptography in TLS and developing high-assurance post-quantum cryptographic software.

At his internship at Cloudflare, he worked on adding post-quantum key-exchange to internal services as well as on the formal analysis of FrodoKEM, a post-quantum key-exchange algorithm, using the Jasmin and EasyCrypt toolchain.
