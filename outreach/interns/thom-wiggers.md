Thom is an intern at Cloudflare Research. His main research interest can be described as "making the internet post-quantum". That might actually become the title of his PhD thesis, which he is working on at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, where Thom is based. Thom's most notable contribution is the work on KEMTLS; a proposal to do TLS without handshake signatures. He can also be found lamenting the loss of the nice non-interactive Diffieâ€“Hellmann based constructions in a post-quantum world, or in his spare time, hanging off a bouldering wall.

## Research Areas
