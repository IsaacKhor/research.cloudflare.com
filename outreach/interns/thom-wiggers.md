Thom was an intern at Cloudflare Research from October 2021 to the end of February 2022. His main research interest can be described as "making the Internet post-quantum". That might actually become the title of his PhD thesis, which he is working on at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, where Thom is based. Thom's most notable contribution is the work on KEMTLS; a proposal to do TLS without handshake signatures. He can also be found lamenting the loss of the nice non-interactive Diffie-Hellmann based constructions in a post-quantum world, or in his spare time, hanging off a bouldering wall.

At Cloudflare, Thom worked on adding post-quantum key exchange to some internal services. He also worked on formal analysis of KEMTLS, using the Tamarin prover. You can read about some of this work in the blog posts below.
