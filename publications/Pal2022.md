Credential stuffing attacks use stolen passwords to log into victim accounts.To defend against these attacks, recently deployed compromised credentialchecking (C3) services provide APIs that help users and companies check whethera username, password pair is exposed. These services however only check if theexact password is leaked, and therefore do not mitigate credential tweakingattacks — attempts to compromise a user account with variants of a user’sleaked passwords. Recent work has shown credential tweaking attacks cancompromise accounts quite effectively even when the credential stuffingcountermeasures are in place.

We initiate work on C3 services that protect users from credential tweakingattacks. The core underlying challenge is how to identify passwords that aresimilar to their leaked passwords while preserving honest clients’ privacy andalso preventing malicious clients from extracting breach data from the service.We formalize the problem and explore ways to measure password similarity thatbalance efficacy, performance, and security. Based on this study, we design“Might I Get Pwned” (MIGP), a new kind of breach alerting service. Oursimulations show that MIGP reduces the efficacy of stateof-the-art 1000-guesscredential tweaking attacks by 94%.  MIGP preserves user privacy and limitspotential exposure of sensitive breach entries. We show that the protocol isfast, with response time close to existing C3 services. We worked withCloudflare to deploy MIGP in practice.
