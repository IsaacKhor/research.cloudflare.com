Passwords are an age-old method of authentication and are used on millions of websites and web services for user accounts. Passwords are a brittle security mechanism because people often reuse passwords and password breaches happen regularly, which in combination exposes users to account compromise. 

In this project, we explore ways to help make password systems safer.
