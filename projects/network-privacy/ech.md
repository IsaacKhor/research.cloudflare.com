This project is about Cloudflare's contributions to Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), a new extension for Transport Layer Security (TLS) that promises to significantly enhance the privacy of this critical Internet protocol.

ECH is the product of close collaboration, facilitated by the IETF, between academics and the tech industry leaders, including Cloudflare, Fastly, Mozilla, and many others.
