This project addresses HTTPS interception and middleboxes, which can often degrade the security of Internet connections.

We have made available two tools:
- MITMEngine: an open-source library for HTTPS interception detection, and
- MALCOLM: a dashboard displaying metrics about HTTPS interception we observe on Cloudflareâ€™s network.
