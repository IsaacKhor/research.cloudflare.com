With the imminent arrival of quantum computers, these will break classical cryptography algorithms and allow to retroactively decrypt any encrypted traffic recorded now.

This project is focused on migrating classical algorithms to post-quantum ones and setting up large scale Post-quantum cryptography experiments in real settings.
