Released in 2019, *CIRCL* (Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library) is an open-source collection of cryptographic algorithms written in Go providing optimized implementations of several primitives for key exchange and digital signatures.

This library includes a set of packages that target post-quantum algorithms, elliptic curve cryptography, hash functions for prime groups, pairing-based cryptography, and quantum-resistant algorithms.

You can read more about the library in our blog posts and check the GitHub repository for recent updates.
