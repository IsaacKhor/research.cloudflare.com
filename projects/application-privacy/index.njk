<h1>Application Privacy</h1>


Primary focus is on improving privacy and user authentication, while reducing or eliminating personal data at the application layer.
<br />
We work in evaluating and applying novel techniques to help protect user information, to carefully analyse user data to improve online experiences (including security), and to create systems that donâ€™t rely on overcollection of personal information. Through standardization contributions we also aim to impact the Internet-wide ecosystem.
